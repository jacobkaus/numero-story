In a small town in Florida there lived a man by the name of Marcus. Marcus
was 24 and is a semi-pro surfer/entrepreneur who wanted to start his very
own business selling clothing. He lived in his beach house and surfed and 
worked all day to achieve his goals.
In time, Marcus saved up enought money to open his own clothing store. Marcus 
was very excited as this would be the beginning of his business and he had 
his plans all set out. Very quickly, the construction of Marcus's store 
began. A few months later the store was finished and it was the day Marcus had 
been waiting for, today Marcus would open his store and start his business.
