In a small town in Florida there lived a man by the name of Marcus. Marcus
was 24 and is a semi-pro surfer/entrepreneur who wanted to start his very
own business selling clothing. He lived in his beach house and surfed and 
worked all day to achieve his goals.
In time, Marcus saved up enought money to open his own clothing store. Marcus 
was very excited as this would be the beginning of his business and he had 
his plans all set out. Very quickly, the construction of Marcus's store 
began. A few months later the store was finished and it was the day Marcus had 
been waiting for, today Marcus would open his store and start his business.
Marcus was so excited to start his store! However, that night when he was out
surfing he was so excited thinking about the prospects of his store that he 
was not paying attention and did not see the shark behind him. The shark attacked
and bit his arm off. At first Marcus was so sad, but then he realized this could
be a buisness opportunity-- making clothing for people with no arms!
Marcus quickly hired clothing designers to make clothes for those who didn't
have arms. He believed that this new type of clothing would be a big seller.
He went through many late nights talking with his designers trying to figure 
out a way to make his clothing stand out. He tried out many different styles-
all of which didn't fit him well or didn't fit his clothing tastes. However,
after weeks of hard work, Marcus finally designed something he was satisfied
with-a tank top but with no sleeves. He believed that this would be a big
seller. This was going to boost his business to became a popular, name brand
clothing.
